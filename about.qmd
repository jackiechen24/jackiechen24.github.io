My name is Jackie Chen, and I am a graduating fourth year Statistics and Data Science Major with a music minor at UCSB. After graduating from UCSB, I will be attending USC for graduate school (for USC's Master of Science in Applied Data Science program). I am from the Bay Area and went to Palo Alto High School (also known as Paly) prior to attending UCSB. I enjoy many different activities, including listening to music (with my favorite artists being Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande), playing music (specifically the flute and piano), spending time with others, playing NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections, exploring cool and fun places, drawing, seeing cute things (such as Sanrio characters and my stuffed animals) and sunsets, and dancing/working out (I am trying to go to the gym at UCSB more often before graduation). At UCSB, I participated in many clubs, especially TASA (Taiwanese American Student Association), Circle K International, and Autism Advocacy & Awareness.
