After graduating from UCSB, I will be attending USC for graduate school. I am from the Bay Area and went to Palo Alto High School (also known as Paly) prior to attending UCSB. I enjoy many different activities, including listening to music (with my favorite artists being Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande), playing music (specifically the flute and piano), spending time with others, playing NYT Games such as Wordle and Connections, drawing, and dancing/working out (I am trying to go to the gym at UCSB more often before graduation)."
